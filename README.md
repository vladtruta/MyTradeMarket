# MyTradeMarket
MyTradeMarket is the app we created for the PoliHack v3 hackathon.

MyTradeMarket is a private trade room prototype app. Just like private chat rooms, where you connect via IP address, our idea was to create the same thing, but oriented towards the selling/buying of products, and done privately.

The advantage of this is that you don’t have to enter your credentials on any website in order to sell your products. Just add them into your private store, and give your customers your IP address, and they will connect and be able to see your products. We thought that this idea would help those who want to sell products in a hassle-free environment that doesn’t spy nor track buyers and sellers.

The application was developed to work with Bitcoin, however it can be extended to work with about any type of currency.
